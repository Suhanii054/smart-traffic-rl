# Traffic Management System using Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a **Traffic Management System** that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize traffic signal timings for improved traffic flow and reduced congestion. The solution is developed and demonstrated in a Google Colab notebook.

---

## 🚦 Overview

Traditional traffic lights operate on fixed timers, often resulting in inefficient traffic management, especially during fluctuating traffic volumes. This project applies RL algorithms to dynamically adjust traffic signals based on real-time traffic conditions, aiming to minimize waiting times and improve throughput at intersections.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Reinforcement Learning:** An agent learns to take actions in a simulated environment to maximize cumulative rewards (reduced wait time, improved flow).
- **Environment:** A simplified intersection with multiple lanes and dynamically changing vehicle counts.
- **Agent:** The RL model (Q-Learning/Deep Q-Network) that chooses the optimal signal action based on the current state.
- **Reward Function:** Designed to penalize long waiting times and reward efficient traffic flows.
- **Simulation:** Traffic is simulated step-by-step, and the agent learns from the outcomes of its actions.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Custom Traffic Simulation:** Models an intersection with multiple lanes and vehicular arrival patterns.
- **RL Agent Training:** Implements Q-Learning (and optionally Deep Q-Networks) to train the agent for optimal signal switching.
- **Visualization:** Plots of cumulative rewards, waiting times, and traffic patterns to analyze model performance.
- **Performance Comparison:** Evaluates RL-based control vs. traditional fixed-timer approach.
